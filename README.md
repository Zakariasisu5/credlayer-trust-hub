## 🎯 The Problem

In decentralized finance, **trust is invisible**. You can't tell if a wallet is:
- A legitimate user or a bot
- Part of a Sybil attack cluster
- Reliable for lending protocols
- Safe to transact with

Traditional credit scores don't exist on-chain, and wallet addresses reveal nothing about behavior or reliability.

## 💡 Our Solution

**CredLayer** is a decentralized reputation engine that transforms on-chain behavior into **explainable trust scores**. We analyze:

- 📊 **Transaction patterns** — volume, frequency, success rates
- 🤝 **Counterparty quality** — who you interact with matters
- 🏦 **DeFi participation** — protocol diversity and repayment history
- 🤖 **AI risk signals** — Sybil detection, anomaly classification, bot scoring
- ⚡ **Real-time analysis** — instant reputation insights for any Solana wallet

## 🧪 Reputation Engine

### How We Calculate Trust Scores

Our deterministic reputation engine analyzes multiple behavioral signals:

**Positive Signals (0-100):**
- 📅 Wallet age (older = more trusted)
- 📈 Transaction activity (consistent usage)
- ✅ Success rate (reliable transactions)
- 🌐 Protocol diversity (broad DeFi participation)
- 💰 Repayment history (lending reliability)
- 🤝 Counterparty quality (who you interact with)

**Risk Penalties (0-100):**
- ⚡ Transaction bursts (bot-like behavior)
- 👥 Sybil cluster proximity (linked wallets)
- ⚠️ Unverified program calls (risky interactions)
- ❌ Failed transaction ratio (unreliable behavior)

**Final Score:**
```
Trust Score = Σ(Positive Signals × Weights) - Σ(Risk Penalties × 0.45)
```

### Risk Classification

- 🟢 **Highly Trusted** (81-100): Elite wallets with proven track record
- 🔵 **Trusted** (61-80): Reliable wallets with good behavior
- 🟡 **Medium Risk** (31-60): Average wallets, proceed with caution
- 🔴 **High Risk** (0-30): Suspicious activity detected
